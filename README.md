See Surface Temperature (SST) data are mostly acquired by means of satellites detecting the infrared radiation emitted from the sea surface. This radiation can be absorbed by clouds, causing large occlusions in collected observations. Filling these gaps is the task of your exam.

We focus on a region of the north adriatic sea. Data are taken from the MODIS dataset; we use the nigthly data collected by the Aqua satellite.

Instructions for downloading data and additional information about the task and the evaluation metrics are contained in the enclosed notebook.
